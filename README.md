# student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

The script will be invoked from the command line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. 

It will have just a text-based interface.

## How to use

Make sure you are in the correct directory (student-directory) before running the script:

```shell
cd student-directory
ruby directory.rb
```
